In this project I use Beautiful Soup to scrape data from fbref.com on the Premier League. Then, I clean this data and use it to predict winners of later games.
I found this experience to be particularly useful in understanding the analyzing of sequential data, as we could only look at past events to predict future ones.
Additionally, I learned a lot about data scraping through this process, especially in terms of analyzing a website's architecture and HTML code. Finally, it was
interesting to see how we could improve the prediction metrics simply by cleaning and organizing our data in more intricate ways. NOTE: This project was inspired
and derives code originally produced by the Youtuber Dataquest, who teaches ML and data analysis in his videos.
